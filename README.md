# ComponentLabels

## Overview
ComponentLabels is an enhanced Python script originally designed for generating resistor labels. It has now evolved to create labels for a variety of electronic components, offering customizable options for different types and sizes of labels.

## Features
- Generates labels for various electronic components, including resistors, capacitors, and more.
- Customizable label layouts for different label sheets and component sizes.
- Supports various coding schemes including color codes, SMD codes, etc.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `reportlab` library for PDF generation

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/xtraorange/ComponentLabels.git`
2. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- To generate labels, modify the `main()` function in `LabelGenerator.py` with your component values.
- Run `python LabelGenerator.py` to create the PDF file.

### Customizing Label Layout
- Detailed steps on how to customize label layouts for different components.
